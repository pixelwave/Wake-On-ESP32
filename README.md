# Wake-On-ESP32
Using an ESP32 to control multiple PCs via Ethernet.

Since WOL (Wake on LAN) was unreliable for me in some use cases and in bulk utilizes to much idle power I build my own system.

You choose between a 5 or 10 port enclosure. WiFi connection or Ethernet (POE). Total Power Consumption is below 1 Watt.

The ESP32 controller is flashed with ESPHome and integrated into my Home Assistant setup for further automation and remote control.
